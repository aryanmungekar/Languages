#here we can perform basic operation on string type of variables just by declaring the datatype before the operation
a = "1"
b = "3"
c = 3

print(int(a) + int(b) + c)


#here we coinvert float to int before the operation therefore the value of a = 2 now.
a = 2.2
b = 4

print(int(a)+b)

#implicite typecasting- here the compiler converts int to folat to give more accurate answer

a = 12.3
b = 4

print(a+b)
